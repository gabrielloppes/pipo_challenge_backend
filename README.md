## Strategy and technical desicions

- ### Strategy Design Pattern<br>

  - The Strategy pattern is an interesting pattern, as it defines a family of algorithms and places each one in a separate class, so that you can use them interchangeably for different actions.

- ### RESTful API approach<br>
  - The advantage of using the RESTful API approach is the decoupling, this way, each layer of the application will have its own responsibility separately.

## Technical debts:

- [x] Create users and authenticate with JWT and encrypt with BcryptJS

- [ ] Validations

- [ ] Test with Jest
